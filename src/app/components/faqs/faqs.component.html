      <h4 style="color:#616161"><strong>What is protein promiscuity?</strong></h4>
    <p>Even though protein promiscuity has been extensively studied in the last few years, the term itself is not well defined yet and has been used to describe many different phenomena, with different classification schemes proposed (Hult and Berglund 2007; López-Iglesias and Gotor-Fernández 2015). From a biological perspective, the term promiscuity may imply not only catalysis, chemical-functional relationship and evolutionary information, but  cellular function too (Nobeli et al. 2009). Khersonsky and Tawfik (Khersonsky and Tawfik 2010) described catalytic promiscuity as an enzyme's capability to catalyze a reaction different from that for what it evolved. But, from a chemical and functional point of view, catalytic promiscuity may be described as the ability of an enzyme to catalyze multiple chemical transformations that are normally classified as different types of reactions (Patrick JO'Brien 1999). We followed this perspective as the general guideline for recognition of promiscuous reactions to be included in <strong>ProtMiscuity</strong>.

      <h4 style="color:#616161"><strong>Which is the importance of promiscuity?</strong></h4>
      <p>
        The notion of promiscuity is intertwined with that of molecular recognition. The evolution of function has often been associated with the initial presence of promiscuity, so understanding promiscuity would improve our knowledge of the processes of evolution. Furthermore, improving our knowladge about promiscuity may contribute with some technological achievements, such as: facilitate progress in protein engineering, directed evolution, drug design for both biomedical or industrial applications.

      <p>
        <p>Many proteins show promiscuous activities in organic media. In our study <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2044-2" target="_blank">'Large scale analysis of protein conformational transitions from aqueous to non-aqueous media'</a> we focused on how the organic solvents may affect the protein function, in order to understand the conformational changes which could favor the promiscuous activity of proteins in this media.

        The Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is the main protein of plasma and also a well studied example of an promiscuous protein. In our study <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10562-018-2386-4" target="_blank"> 'A Mild Procedure for Enone Preparation Catalysed by Bovine Serum Albumin in a Green and Easily Available Medium'</a>, we described how BSA can promiscuously catalize the synthesis of α,β-unsaturated ketones from acetone and a set of benzaldehydes.
